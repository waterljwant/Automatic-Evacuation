# Abstract
For the withdrawaling problem of small ground mobile robots in the field, an automatic withdrawal system for the small ground mobile robot is designed and implemented. The 2D Laser radar is used for environmental perception and terminal precise navigation. Firstly, an adaptive curvature filter algorithm is proposed to process the radar data filtering. Then, in the process of guiding target detection, the scattered data are clustered according to the density and nearest adjacent distance measuring. The target detection and matching are carried out by using the geometric structure constraint between the guidance target and the auxiliary target. Finally, the real-time obstacle avoidance and the optimal forward direction selection are conduct based on the method of influence layer division and candidate direction estimation. Thus the robot is accurately guided to accomplish the automatic withdrawal. The developed automatic withdrawal system is validated in the natural environment. And some aspects of automatic withdrawal system are analyzed experimentally. Experiments show that the proposed method can effectively accomplish the autonomous withdrawal of the small ground mobile robot in the natural environment.
